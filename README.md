# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This study guide was created to help students take useful and organized notes as they go through the bootcamp. I built this project to give students a simple note taking template and make the course easier to follow. The study guide has a clean look to it, making it easier for students to take notes and refer back to them quicker when they need to. I learned how much goes into creating a well designed website and the backbone languages of a simple website.
